<h1><b>Cricket Simulator</b></h1><br>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<h2><strong>Develop a cricket simulation program that emulates a match between two teams, each comprising 5 players.</strong></h2>




<ul>
    <ul>
        <li>The simulation spans two innings, with each inning encompassing 5 overs, and each over comprising 6 balls.</li>
        <li><strong>Player Composition:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Team 1 Players:</a> 3 batsmen, 2 bowlers</li>
            <li><a href="#">Team 2 Players:</a> 3 batsmen, 2 bowlers</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Implement simulation logic for both innings.</li>
        <li>User input is required for the outcomes of 5 balls during each over, considering events such as runs, wickets, wides, and no-balls.</li>
        <li>If a team loses 2 wickets within 5 overs, their inning concludes.</li>
        <li>Wides and no-balls contribute 1 run to the team's score.</li>
        <li>If a batsman scores an odd run, the striker will switch, and if they score an even run, the striker will retain the position until an odd run is scored.</li>
        <li>Striker and bowler switch within each over according to the run-scoring rule.</li>
        <li>Display the Winner and Team's score board</li>
        <li>Display the Player's individual score and wickets</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
